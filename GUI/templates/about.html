        <p>
            The Skin Disease Classification System is designed to assist dermatologists
            in diagnosing skin diseases by using artificial intelligence to analyze images of skin conditions.
            This system uses deep learning algorithms to provide an initial assessment of skin images,
            which can help streamline the diagnostic process and provide quick feedback to patients.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our system is built on state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks that have been trained
            on thousands of images from the HAM10000 dataset. These models are capable of recognizing
            multiple types of skin diseases with high accuracy, providing a valuable second opinion to healthcare professionals.
